### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jorge and I'm practically **new** to this stuff... Am I supposed to tell you stuff about me? Okay then!!

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: My pronouns are He/Him - They/Them
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in HTML and... Python!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently studying Bachillerato!

And... well, that's kinda all for now. I hope I can add more stuff in the future!
See you soon!
